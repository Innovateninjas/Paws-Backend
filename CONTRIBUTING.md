   python manage.py shell -c "from django.core.management.utils import get_random_secret_key; print(get_random_secret_key())" 
   ```

**Database(mandatory)**
- Set up a postgres db locally or in any cloud provider like vercel, and add the detail in **.env** file. SEE **.example.env**
- With Docker, the PostgreSQL database setup is handled automatically but make sure you added db details in **.env**
